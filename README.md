# OOP Demonstration in JavaScript

This repository contains a simple and comprehensive implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript, using a `Student` class as an example. The project demonstrates the four main pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

## Overview

- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single class. It also involves using getters and setters to restrict direct access to some of the object's properties.
- **Inheritance:** Creating a new class that inherits properties and methods from an existing class.
- **Polymorphism:** Defining methods in different classes that share the same name but have different implementations.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features of an object.
